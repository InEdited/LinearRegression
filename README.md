# linear_regression


A simple python script that does a simple linear regression by gradient descent.

Should be provided with a .csv file with a table of many instances of a dependant and an independant variable to calculate the best line of fitting in these points.

Currently output is the the values of best fitting "b" and "m" values in the y = mx +b equation.

==============================

To-Do:
-add a visualizing function for the script
-add an adaptation ability for the learning rate and the number of iterations to produce better values
-add an error calculating function
-provide a full gui with drag and drop functionality
-speeding up the script for huge data sets using CUDA python for multiprocessing on GPUs
